Comments on build:
With the idea that the final product might be changed aesthically, I aimed for a professional look, using blacks, offwhites, grays and green. I laid out employee information in a responsive grid based layout. For the navigation bar, I used javascript to give INVENTORY click functionality and I made it stick to the top as the user scrolls down. I also added an image/text company logo. 

The mind set going in was to make a simple and clean mock up, focusing on easy to navigate code, add responsiveness, and adhering to the directions given. In this sense, I can make aesthetic adjustments easily if the client requires.
